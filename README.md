Read on and find out!

### Tmux configuration

Nice and sane configuration is provided with `tmux.conf`, including:
 - Powerful status bar (see [screenshot](#screenshot)).
 - Screen like binding (`Ctrl-a` instead of `Ctrl-b` as the prefix).
 - vim keybindings.

### Mercurial configuration

Sane defaults and some nice and pretty alias:
 - `hg l`: similar to `hg log`, but with nice format and colors.
 - `hg gl`: similar to `hg glog`, but also with nice format and colors.
